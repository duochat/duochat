# DuoChat

Duochat is a new professional social media app targeted especially at aspiring entrepreneurs in high school that takes a fresh approach to professional networking.
We actively seeks to help users expand their network and make new meaningful connections with people they havenâ€™t met before.

## Developing
DuoChat uses flutter, an open-source UI software development kit by Google that allows us to rapidly develop beautiful cross-platform applications.

#### How to run the app
To run the app locally, follow these steps.
1. [Install flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Install the dependencies by running `flutter pub get` in a command line
3. Open up a local simulator or connect your phone to your computer, then run `flutter run` to launch the application.

The source code for this application can be found in the `lib/` directory.

## Open Source Software and Licenses
DuoChat is made possible by numerous open source libraries and tools, including: 

- Firebase
- Flutter
- Dart
