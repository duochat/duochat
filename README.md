# DuoChat

Duochat is a new professional social media app targeted especially at aspiring entrepreneurs in high school that takes a fresh approach to professional networking.
We actively seeks to help users expand their network and make new meaningful connections with people they havenâ€™t met before.

## Developing
DuoChat uses flutter, an open-source UI software development kit by Google that allows us to rapidly develop beautiful cross-platform applications.

To run the app locally, [install flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install), then install the dependencies with `flutter pub get` and run the app on a local simulator or connected device with `flutter run`.

## Open Source Software
DuoChat is made possible by numerous open source libraries and tools, including: 

- Firebase
- Flutter
-
